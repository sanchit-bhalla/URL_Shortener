# URL_Shortener 
The URL_Shortener is prepared using: 
> django 
> html5,css3
> Bootstrap 3

The URL_Shortener convert the url submitted by user into string of 6 characters that includes [a-z,0-9,A-Z]. This is then combined with the url i.e. 127.0.0.1:8000. And the resultant url when used redirects user to the original url.

Example:
Url submitted by user : https://github.com/PiyushKhanna30/
Short code generated : i9GnKg
Output url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/i9GnKg
